<h1> Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI</h2>
This is an Artificial Intelligence Program designed to play the game of Tic Tac Toe against a human and it <b><i>never</i></b> loses!
The game ends up being either a draw or a win for the computer. It has been coded such that the computer is so smart, it is impossible for the human to beat my AI.

I would appreciate it if you could provide constructive feedback on how can I remove redundant code (if there is), make it faster, more readable or really any improvements you can see!

## Download Instructions
Clone the repository and run <b>AI_TicTacToe.exe</b> .
Thats all!
