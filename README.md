<h1> Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI</h2>
This is an Artificial Intelligence Program designed to play the game of Tic Tac Toe against a human and <b><i>Never</i></b> lose!
The game ends up being either a draw or a win for the computer. It is impossible for the human to beat my AI.

I would appreciate it if you could provide constructive feedback on how can i remove redundant code (if there is), make it faster, more readable or really any improvements you can see!
